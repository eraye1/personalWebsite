          <h2 id="WCC2013Game6" class="featurette-heading"> Magnus Carlsen vs Viswanathan Anand, Game 6.</h2>
          <h4 id="challenger" class="featurette-heading"> Challenger and Throne. </h4>
          <p> <strong>Viswanathan Anand</strong> is the reigning world champion since 2007. Known as the Tiger of Madras, he is one of 6 players to ever break the 2800 FIDE rating threshold and is one of the greatest talents to ever play chess.  The 43-year old Indian Grandmaster is known to solve complicated tactical problems in seconds and has won the world speed chess championship before.  He is known for his fierce attacking style and ability to come ahead in complicated positions.  He is also known as a master in match play, having defeated Vladimir Kramnik, Veselin Topalov and Boris Gelfand in the defense of his throne.   His opening preparation and tactical brilliance is second-to-none.  Currently rated at 2775 FIDE, he is the 7th player by rating in the world.</p>
          <p> <strong>Magnus Carlsen</strong> is the number one rated player in the world and has been since 2010 (FIDE rating 2870, almost 70 more than the second place player).  This is the highest rating ever achieved by a human and by form he is very likely the best player who ever played the game.  The 23-year-old Norweigan grandmaster's rise in the chess world was meteoric, dominating major tournaments in a fashion not seen since Kasparov's heyday.  He is known for his positional play and his ability to pull wins out of drawn positions and thin air.  He also plays soccer and models in his spare time.</p>
          <p> <strong>Comparison: </strong> Anand is the far more experience match player and will likely have prepared powerful rebuttals and openings for Magnus to play against.  Magnus will attempt to play openings that will take Anand out of his element and the Norweigan will likely try for complicated endgames which favor his younger mind and playing style.  </p>
          <h4 id="game6sofar" class="featurette-heading"> So far... </h4>
          <p> Viswanathan Anand is down 3-2 in this best of 12.  He is not in desperation mode yet, but he is at a disadvantage.  But he possesses the white pieces this game.  At this point, he has still not defeated Carlsen, despite having an minute advantage in several games.  The first four games were all drawn, despite some fighting chess in games 3 and 4. I expect Anand to have some new novelties for Carlsen to deal with in Game 6.</p>
          <h4 id="game6chess" class="featurette-heading"> Game Analysis </h4>
          <p><strong>1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 </strong> Ruy Lopez once again from Anand, let's see how Carlsen responds!</p>
          <p><strong>3... Nf6!? </strong> and he goes for it!  Carlsen challenges Anand again, confident his seconds have not found a way to repute this solid opening.  An interesting psychological move to repeat openings from Carlsen.  Note that white cannot win a pawn here, 4. Nxe4 Qe7! and black regains material balance by taking the pawn on e4 and gaining tempo.</p>
          <p><strong>4. d3 Bc5 5. c3 </strong> c3 to prepare for d4, challenging black's control of the d4 square and opening up the position.  </p>
          <p><strong>5... 0-0 6. 0-0 Re8 7. Re1 a6 8. Ba4 b5 9. Bb3 d6 10. Bg5 </strong> Here Anand comes up with a novelty and deviates from standard play in the Closed Ruy Lopez.  This move has not been tried out before.  How will Carlsen deal with the dual threats of d4 and the pinned Nc6 knight?</p>
          <p><strong>10...Be6</strong> Carlsen spends 20 minutes before making this move.  The idea he has is to manuveur the c6-knight to d7 via Nb8-d7 to defend the knight from the pin.  Note that this move must be played before the knight ends up on d7 else the bishop can only move to b7, a less active spot than e6.  However, computer analysis shows this to be a small mistake.  11. Bxe6 fxe6 (11 ...Rxe6 blunders into 12. d4! Bb4 13. d5 Bxe6.+-) and white still has the powerful d4 advance along with having doubled black's pawns.</p>
          <p><strong>11. Nbd2?!</strong> an extremely passive move.  The key variations follow Bxe6 or Bd5.  Now Magnus can seize a small advantage by doubling white's pawns.  He also has a clear plan via breaking the knight pin with the other knight and exchanging pieces for a superior end-game due to superior pawn structure.</p> 
          <p><strong>11...h6 12.B h4 Bxb3 13. axb3 Nb8 14. h3 Nbd7 15. Nh2 Qe7</strong> Anand has finally revealed his idea, he wants to attack the f6-knight via Ng4, but Carlsen responds with Qe7, going Qe6 if Ng4.  Then white has issues with placing his g4-knight.  Black's queen if fairly safe now that light-square bishops are off the board, and white would then have to content with d5 as well.</p>
          <p><strong>16. Ndf1</strong> Anand replies with the idea of Ne6-f5, allowing strong kingside pressure from his f5-knight.  There's no good way to dislodge this knight either, with both knights tied up currently and light-square bishops gone.  g6 is an obviously bad move since white still possesses enough pieces near the king-side that weakening the pawn structure is bad.  Carlsen can respond with either moving towards a d5 break or doing Bb5 with the idea of a queenside advance via a5 and b4.</p>
          <p><strong>16... Bb5 17. Ne3 Qe6 18. b4</strong> black will play a5 sooner or later else his a6 pawn is a weakness in the endgame (which will undoubtably include rooks).  With b4, white can remove his doubled pawns by exchanging on a5 and making black's life a little more difficult.</p>
          <p><strong>18... a5 19. bxa5 Bxa5</strong> white can now play Nf5, but black and break the center with d5.  This position is about equal with counterchances for both sides.  Kh7 is key against any of white's kingside attacking ideas.</p>
          <p><strong>20. Nhg4 Bb6 21. Bxf6</strong> exchanges are coming with most minor pieces likely coming off.  Pawn structures and king positions are basically identical.  Even though this is theoretically even, Queen-rook endgames with pawns likely favor Carlsen's positional play more than Anand's tactical genius.</p>
          <p><strong>21... Nxf6 22. Nxf6+ Qxf6 23. Qg4 Bxe3 24. fxe3 Qe7</strong>Carlsen said himself this is very likely drawn, very modest advantage to black on his pawn structure.</p>
          <p><strong>25. Rf1 c5 26. Kh2 c4 27. d4 Rxa1 28. Rxa1 Qb7 29. Rd1</strong> Anand's past moves have been to draw this position.  Black is pressuring the e4 pawn and threatens to isolate white's e-pawns via 30... exd4 31. Rxd4 (31. exd4 drops the e-pawn via 31... Qxe4).  Still modest advantage for black, but most rook positions can be drawn.</p>
          <p><strong>29...Qc6 30. Qf5 exd4 31. Rxd4 Re5 32. Qf3 Qc7!?</strong> Good move by Carlsen to prevent Queen penetration.  Here he has a clear plan to pressure e4 and advance the kingside pawns and generate kingside pressure.  It is difficult for white to find a plan here as he is mostly just fending off black's ideas.  ANand is very likely getting tired at this point in the match as well.</p>
          <p><strong>33. Kh1 Qe7 34. Qg4 Kh7 35. Qf4 g6 36. Kh2 Kg7 37. Qf3 Re6 38. Qg3?!</strong> Anand sacrificing a pawn to simplify the position here.  Still is likely drawn due to the presence of the rooks, but now drawing becomes much more difficult.  A questionable move. </p>
          <p><strong>38...Rxe4 39. Qxd6 Rxe3 40. Qxe7 Rxe7 41. Rd5 Rb7 42.Rd6 f6!</strong> A strong move and a good idea .  Black must advance his pawns to cause threats against white.  And Carlsen obeys the first tenet of pawn attacks.  Always advance the pawn without an oppoing pawn.</p>
          <p><strong>43. h4 Kf7?!</strong> Not the strongest.  Stronger is 43... h5 and eventually placing the rook on e5 gives black a comfortable and perhaps even winning position.  Now Anand can creep back in.</p>
          <p><strong>44. h5!</strong> Anand seizes the chance here.  Now a draw seems very likely with the doubled h-pawns.</p>
          <p><strong>44...gxh5 45. Rd5 Kg6 46. Kg3 Rb6 47. Rc5 f5 48. Kh4 Re6 49. Rxb5 Re4+ 50. Kh3 Kg5 51. Rb8 h4 52. Rg8+ Kh5 53. Rf8 Rf4 54. Rc8 Rg4 55. Rf8 Rg3+ 56. Kh2 Kg5 57. Rg8+? </strong> Anand makes a key mistake here.  It is much more difficult to defend this position now as white's king advanges to f4 and then e3.  Instead, Rc8 holds the draw comfortably.</p>
          <p><strong>57...Kf4 58.Rc8 Ke3 59.Rxc4 f4</strong> Carlsen seems to have a massive advantage here but computer analysis suggests otherwise.  Anand can still play one trump card.  Will the Tiger from Madras find it?</p>
          <p><strong>60. Ra4?</strong> Anand misses his last chance.  60. b4! can save his position by generating queen-side counterplay.  Both players said in the post-game interview they dismissed this move as too slow, but it holds this position.  </p>
          <p><strong>60...h3 61. gxh3 Rg6 62. c4 f3 63. Ra3+</strong> Loses the game.  But there is no way to hold this position.  There is no way to stop the f-pawn.  The c-pawn is simply too slow after Anand failed to find 60. b4.</p>
          <p><strong>63...Ke2 64.b4 f2 65.Ra2+ Kf3 66.Ra3+ Kf4 67.Ra8 Rg1 0-1</strong> There is no way to stop the f-pawn and when white exchanges his rook for it, black will be up a rook.</p>
          <h4 id="game6postgame" class="featurette-heading"> Post-game Analysis </h4>
          <p>Anand showed the disparity between his end-game play and Carlsen's play.  Carlsen showed his mental domination by slowly chipping away at Anand's psyche via positional pressure.  Finally, Anand makes a critical mistake and Carlsen exploits it for a win.  Anand is known as someone who doesn't take losses easily so this second loss will likely crush his spirits.  Luckily, there is a rest day next, so Anand can rest up and prepare for the next game.  Carlsen now leads 4-2, a comfortable lead at the half-way mark.  The first player to 6.5 points wins, so Carlsen simply needs to draw 5 of his next 6 to win.  If Carlsen wins again, Anand faces the almost insurmountable task of being forced to win 3/5 of the remaining games.  Like Bobby Fischer said, "Chess is war over the board. The object is to crush the opponent's mind.".  Carlsen certainly did that the past two games.</p>

          <h2 id="WCC2013Game3" class="featurette-heading"> Magnus Carlsen vs Viswanathan Anand, Game 3.<span class="text-muted"> Magnus stumbles again as white, Anand too passive to seize control. </span></h2>
          <p>Thoughts about Magnus-Anand game 3.  </p>
          <p>Magnus is trying way too hard here.  He is, by far, the best chess player on this planet.  He should just play his game.  Start with 1. e4 and do the Ruy Lopez.  Sure, Anand will likely have some tricks, but you can't play the Reti opening every game the next 4 times you play white.  The first game Magnus tried this, he barely equalized and had to rely on Anand being content with a draw.  Then, third game he runs the Reti again!  You can see Magnus's state of mind when he plays 13. Bb4.  It's a forcing move and aggressive.  But surely he accounted for 13... Be6, which forces the Queen back with tempo.  All the major analytics engines agree that white had around a 0.3 advantage but after 13. Bb4, black now has a better position.  He has a centralized bishop now in the same position and removes one of white's bishops.  </p>
          <p>While it's possible and even likely he has some theoretical improvement on the main Reti lines, I feel he's thrown off by Anand's reputation as an excellent match player with openings.  It doesn't help that Anand has Peter Leko helping him as a second either.  </p>
          <p>I like how the 2013 chess championship is streamed and annotated by Susan Polgar and Ramesh.  Both are top-notch commentators and players.  But it would be helpful to split up the commentary into 2 different commentaries.  Have 1 commentator talk to actual players and 1 talk to people who know the basic moves.  Beginners are going to be bored and confused when commentators discuss transposing from one opening to another in detail, but amateurs are going to be bored if you talk about how your pawns shouldn't be doubled.    </p> 
          <p>As an amateur player, I'm rooting for Magnus here.  He's the type of swashbuckling marketable persona chess needs to have a breakthrough.  But the old chess captain me is telling me that Anand holds the advantage here.  He's making Magnus play his game.</p>
